# Leveraging Confidence Intervals for Effective Stock Management
This repository demonstrates the application of Inferential Statistics concepts, specifically Confidence Intervals (CIs), using Python and Jupyter Notebook to develop an effective stock management strategy for a shoe manufacturing company.

NOTE: I greatly acknowledge the Udemy course 'The Data Science Course: Complete Data Science Bootcamp 2024' (URL: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/?couponCode=ST21MT121624) for sharing the dataset. If there are any restrictions regarding sharing this dataset through my GitHub, please contact me via Udemy at userID 'Kimon Ioannis Lappas' and I will immediately delete both the original and cleaned datasets.

The instructor originally used Excel to present a brief version of the confidence intervals' application. In this repository, I have transformed this idea into a complete and practical Python project using Jupyter Notebook.

## CONCLUSIONS:
Assuming the role of a manager for this shoe company and using the provided dataset, my primary objective would be to infer monthly sales data. However, focusing solely on monthly data poses the risk of information overload. For example, customers making exceptionally large purchases once or twice a year could cause inventory management challenges during those months. To address this, adopting a quarterly or semi-annual (6-month) analysis would help identify trends in large stock purchases more effectively. Still, assuming limitations exist on excessively large purchases, the monthly sales data remain a reliable basis for inventory management. The upper limits of the monthly sales confidence intervals provide solid production targets, ensuring sufficient stock levels to minimize the risk of losing sales due to stockouts of specific shoe models.
