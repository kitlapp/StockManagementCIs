# confidence_intervals
This repo showcases the application of some Inferential Statistics concepts (Confidence Intervals - CIs) using Python and Jupyter over a specific dataset.

The motivation of this repo comes from a Udemy course, "The Data Science Course: Complete Data Science Bootcamp 2024". This course has inspired me twice already (see my projects "jupyter_pdf_simple_analysis" and "cal_houses"). It seems that it is a great source of knowledge, providing excellent ideas for applying this knowledge in real-life situations. The instructor used Excel to showcase the practical application of course section's theory, whereas I used Jupyter Notebook. Therefore, I used the Udemy course as a guide to minimize the risk of mistakes in statistics theory. What is presenting in this repo is my way of transfering this existed idea to a practical project that can be showcased on GitHub.

The repo includes two files:
1) The original Excel dataset of Al Bundy's shoe company.
2) The Jupyter Notebook in which I calculated the CIs.

My puprose was to detaily demonstrate the process needed in order to succesfully calculate the CIs of a dataset. I calculated the CIs for three different future periods of shoes sales (yearly, quarterly and monthly) making the apropriate data manipulations prior to each calculation. The results are compared with each other and visualizations are presented for each period to highlight these differences. The improvement of the results as the sample size increases can be clearly observed throughout the project. This makes the company's decision making safer and determines the future strategies for managing the shoe inventory. 

What I gained from this project:
1) I learnt to distinguish between the Predictive and Inferential Statistics. Although the project is helpful for indentifying future inventory strategies and better controlling the company's production, it does not provide future sale predictions but only statistically significant results helping the company's people drawing important conclusions.
2) Practised more with Python for Data Science.
3) Applied CIs in practise. In my experience, the practical application of even the easiest theory is much different than the theory itself.

Please feel free to check this project. 

Thank you!
